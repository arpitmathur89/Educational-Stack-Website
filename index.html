					<h1 style="color:#0d923f;">RLC Circuit</h1>
					<p>An RLC circuit is an electrical circuit consisting of a resistor (R), an inductor (L), and a capacitor (C), connected in series or in parallel.</p>
					<p>The applications of the resonance of the series and parallel LC circuits mainly involve in communications systems and signal processing. The common application of an LC circuit is, tuning radio TXs and RXs. For instance, when we tune a radio to an exact station, then the circuit will set at resonance for that specific carrier frequency. A parallel resonant LC circuit is used to provide current magnification and also used in the RF amplifier circuits as the load impedance, the amplifier’s gain is max at the resonant frequency.</p>

				  <div id="pn-junction">
					<h1 style="color:#0d923f;">p-n junction</h1>
					<p>P-N junctions form the basis for most semiconductor devices. The unique electrical properties attributed to P-N junctions allow production of semiconductor devices of great variety and versatility, including diodes, thyristors, transistors, solar cells, LEDs, and more.</p>
				  </div>
				  <div id="bipolar">	 	
					<h1 style="color:#0d923f;">Bipolar junction transistor</h1>
					<p>A bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is a semiconductor device constructed by layering three doped semiconductor materials to form two P-N junctions. An electrode is attached to each layer of the the BJT. The middle layer of the bipolar junction transistor, called the base, consists of either n-type or p-type material, and the outside layers, called the collector and emitter, are the opposite of the base type. As such, there are are two types of bipolar junction transistors - PNP transistors and NPN transistors.</p>
				  </div>
				  <div id="integrated-circuit">	
					<h1 style="color:#0d923f;">Integrated circuit</h1>
					<p>Integrated circuits, also called "chips", are electronic circuits where all the components (transistors, diodes, resistors and capacitors) has been manufactured in the surface of a thin substrate of semiconductor material.</p>
				  </div>
				  <div id="logic-gate">	
					<h1 style="color:#0d923f;">Logic Gate</h1>
					<p>A logic gate is an elementary building block of a digital circuit. Most logic gates have two inputs and one output. At any given moment, every terminal is in one of the two binary conditions low (0) or high (1), represented by different voltage levels. The logic state of a terminal can, and generally does, change often, as the circuit processes data. In most logic gates, the low state is approximately zero volts (0 V), while the high state is approximately five volts positive (+5 V). There are seven basic logic gates: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XNOR.</p>

				  <div id="cpu">	
					<h1 style="color:#0d923f;">Central Processing Unit</h1>
					<p>"CPU" stands for "Central Processing Unit." It is the active element in nearly all computers, including desktops, laptops, smart phones, and anything else; nowadays dishwashers and refrigerators have them, too, as do cars. The CPU is what tells everything else what to do: Move around, operate devices like disks and displays, and so on. It does so by following instructions placed in the computer's memory, which contain codes telling it to do those things. It also does (most) arithmetic operations - add, subtract, multiply, etc. It also makes decisions, which are expressed by the instructions codes in a form such as "if this value is zero, start following instructions from this place, rather than the next sequential instruction."</p>
					</div>
					<div id="von-neumann">
					<h1 style="color:#0d923f;">Von Neumann Architecture</h1>
					<p>The Von Neumann architecture, is a design of computer system where there essentially three different entities, a processing unit, an i/o unit and an storage unit. The units are connected over buses. 
					<p>The processing unit can be broken down into a coupe of subunits, the ALU, the processing control unit and the program counter. The ALU compute the arithmetic logic needed to run programs (adding and subtracting to registers etc.) To be simple, the control unit just controls the flow of data through the processor. It could be called the brain of the processor if you will. The program essentially points to when you are in instruction memory, it keeps track of what instruction you are running at the moment and increments when done.</p>
					<p>The i/o unit essentially encompasses all i/o the computer could possibly do (printing to a monitor, to paper, inputs from a mouse or keyboard, etc.)</p>
					<p>The storage unit stores anything the computer would need to store and retrieve. This includes local harddrive storage, cache storage, and ram. There are arguments as to whether instruction memory should be included here or in the processing unit. Most people include it there (the Harvard architecture solves this by making instruction and data memory their own units).</p>
